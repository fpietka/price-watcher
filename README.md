# Price watcher

A small script that fetches item title and prices, then list and sum them up for you. It is written using Python 3 and [Beautiful Soup 4](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/)

On Debian based OS, use the following to install BS4 package:
```
aptitude install python3-bs4
```

For now it can fetch from two (french) websites. Adapters will have to be written for others.
